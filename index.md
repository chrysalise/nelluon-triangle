# The Adventures into the Nelluon Triangle 
### Mini-campaign wiki and reference guide 

Welcome, adventurer! This site contains reference material for the mini-campaign so that you may look up information relevant to your adventures in the Nelluon Triangle region of the Meropis Isle world (credit to Matt Hale for the world building). 

The site organized as follows: we have [character](characters.md) pages that contain all information about player characters, NPCs, and other notable or historically significant characters you may encounter in the world. This is a @character. This is a #issue.
